# CineMatch

A movie recommendation website to track and recommend films based on user preferences.  Allows users to create accounts, save watchlists, mark movies as "Watched" or add to "Liked" lists, and take a quiz to receive personalised movie suggestions based on genre and keywords. The system uses data from 'The Movies Dataset' stored in a MySQL database and the TMDB API, with a quiz system that generates new recommendations each time. The project also includes search and filtering functionality for movie discovery. Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, PHP.
