HOW TO USE GITHUB:

1. when you open the project, firstly 'update project' to you can see the most recent changes
2. if you want to work on the project, ALWAYS create a new branch: '+ new branch'
3. make all of your changes and when it you are done, click 'commit' and write a small comment of changes made
5. now click 'push' then click 'create pull request '- it will automatically send changes to the github repo
6. once the commit is checked for merge conflicts - all the changes are pushed to the main branch
7. now you can safely checkout to main branch: REMOTE > ORIGIN > MAIN : checkout
DO NOT CHECKOUT onto LOCAL, ALWAYS REMOTE.

SUMMARY:
- UPDATE project upon first launch
- ALWAYS create new branch, DO NOT work in MAIN
- COMMIT, PUSH, CREATE PULL REQUEST
- Checkout onto REMOTE, NOT local
